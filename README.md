Universal Social Media Image Photoshop Template
======
**Universal Social Media Image Photoshop Template** is a Photoshop template I made to save time in creating images for posting on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter - although it works well on other platforms too. I use it to create one image that can be shared on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter with good results on all, rather than creating multiple images in multiple sizes for each platform.

## Using the Template

Instead of having to create multiple images for different social media posts like:

* Facebook Shared Image: 1200 x 630
* Facebook Shared Link: 1200 x 627
* Facebook Highlighted Image: 1200 x 717
* Facebook Event Image: 1920 x 1080
* Instagram: 1080 x 1080
* Instagram Landscape: 1080 x 566
* Twitter: 440 x 220

this template creates and image that is 1600 pixels wide by 800 pixels high and the resolution is 72dpi that formats well in all the above. The safe area for Instagram is marked with guides and a layer you can overlay. You don't want anything vital to your image to be outside of the Instagram area or within the about 150 pixels on either side of the image. The image should still be full width and height, just make sure that the important stuff like text is in the Instagram safe area.
